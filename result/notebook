No luck with fastdist of Fastphylip  in my computer.
fastdist s001.align.1.msl
<?xml version="1.0"?>

Reinstalled fastphylip program in hope to see it working .
No luck at all :((
Decided to work with Phylip protdist and Phylip neighbor program instead of fastdist and fnj respectively
as Fastphylip was bluffing me . But given alignments are fast format , so I had to convert these to phylip
format to feed to Phylip protdist .

Only focused on writing module to detect a noisy column based on following
    * there are indels,
    * at least 50% of amino acids are unique,

Finalising  Module to invoke Phylip protdist and Phylip neighbor

Finalising  Module to   covert noise reduced alignment to phylip file

20/12/2012
writing runall driver script to accomplish all the task

Decied to use MySQL but later figured out not that good idea as I had to do one more step (converting all
given alignment to phylip format)
